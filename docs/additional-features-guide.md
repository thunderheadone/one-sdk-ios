Follow any of the steps below to access further functions of the SDK. 

You will typically use these functions to extend the codeless functionality, turn off specific codeless functions or if you are adopting a pure programmatic integration. 

### Opt an end-user out of or into tracking
The following methods allow you to opt a user out of various levels of tracking and also opt them back in based on your app's privacy configuration.

*Note:*
- By default all `opt` options are set to `opt:In`.

#### Opt an end-user out/in of all tracking
Use this option to opt an end-user out or in of all tracking.

##### Opt an end-user out of all tracking
To opt out an end-user from all tracking when the end-user does not give permission to be tracked in the client app, call the opt out method as shown below:

Swift:
```swift
One.opt(.out, forOptions: .allTracking)
```

Objective-C:
```objective-c
[One opt:Out forOptions:AllTracking];
```

*Note:*
- When you opt out a user from all tracking all of the other opt out options will be also opted out, tracking will stop and locally queued data will be removed.
- For instructions on how to completely remove a user's data from Thunderhead ONE or Salesforce Interaction Studio - see our [api documentation](https://thunderheadone.github.io/one-api/#operation/delete).

##### Opt an end-user in for all tracking
To opt in an end-user for all tracking when the end-user gives permission to be tracked in the client app, call the opt in method as shown below:

Swift:
```swift
One.opt(.in, forOptions: .allTracking)
```

Objective-C:
```objective-c
[One opt:In forOptions:AllTracking];
```

#### Opt an end-user out/in of all keychain Tid storage

*Note:*
- When opted out, tracking will stop and locally queued data will be removed.
- For instructions on how to completely remove a user's data from Thunderhead ONE or Salesforce Interaction Studio - see our [api documentation](https://thunderheadone.github.io/one-api/#operation/delete).

### Capture data from other SDKs

To capture data from other SDKs, add the method signatures to `Method Overrides` under `Thunderhead Config`.

For example, given the class interface

```objective-c
@interface THAnalytics : NSObject

+ (void)trackEventWithName:(NSString *)eventName properties:(NSDictionary *)properties;

- (void)logIdentityWithName:(NSString *)identityName parameters:(NSDictionary *)parameters;

- (void)logIdentityWithName:(NSString *)identityName;

@end
```

* To capture data from `class method` `trackEventWithName:properties:` 
* To capture data from `instance method` `logIdentityWithName:parameters:` 
* To capture data from `instance method` `logIdentityWithName:` 

from `THAnalytics` class, add the following to your app's Info.plist file

![Thunderhead Config Method Overrides App's Info.plist file](https://github.com/thunderheadone/one-sdk-ios/raw/master/images/ThunderheadConfigMethodOverridesInfoPlistEntry.png)

```xml
<key>Thunderhead Config</key>
  <dict>
    <key>Method Overrides</key>
    <array>
      <string>THAnalytics+trackEventWithName:properties:</string>
      <string>THAnalytics-logIdentityWithName:parameters:</string>
      <string>THAnalytics-logIdentityWithName:</string>
    </array>
  </dict>
  ``` 

The SDK will capture the data when the configured methods are invoked.

*Note:*
- The SDK will only send Codeless Interactions when the first argument (String) matches a configured interaction in the Interaction Map. For additional information, please refer [Sending Interaction requests based on the Interaction map](https://github.com/thunderheadone/one-sdk-ios#sending-interaction-requests-based-on-the-interaction-map).
- When capturing data from class methods, use `+` between `class name` and `method signature`.
- When capturing data from instance methods, use `-` between `class name` and `method signature`.
- Interaction paths with spaces are replaced with an underscore to ensure the Interaction path is valid in ONE.

#### Capture data from other SDKs feature compatibility table

The table below illustrates the compatibility of Capturing data from other SDKs based upon the programming language used.

| App (Language) | Other SDK (Language) | Captures Data |
| -------------- | -------------------- | ------------- |
| Objective-C    | Objective-C          | YES           |
| Objective-C    | Swift                | YES           |
| Swift          | Objective-C          | YES           |
| Swift          | Swift                | NO            |

### Disable `WKWebView` tracking

To disable `WKWebView` codeless tracking, add the following to your app’s Info.plist file and set `DisableWKWebViewTracking` to `YES` (boolean value).

![Thunderhead Config WKWebView Disable App's Info.plist file](https://github.com/thunderheadone/one-sdk-ios/raw/master/images/ThunderheadConfigWKWebViewInfoPlistEntry.png)

```xml
<key>Thunderhead Config</key>
<dict>
  <key>Swizzling Options</key>
  <dict>
    <key>DisableWKWebViewTracking</key>
    <true/>
  </dict>
</dict>
``` 

### Late initialization and reconfiguration of the SDK

Need to late initialize or reconfigure the SDK to support multiple regions in your app? - see details [here](https://github.com/thunderheadone/one-sdk-ios/tree/master/examples/dynamic-initialization-example).

### Manually set a specific Interaction path

The SDK automatically assigns an Interaction path to each view controller. To override the Interaction path that is created automatically, call your view controller and pass your desired Interaction path as a string to the view controller’s `oneInteractionPath` property.

In your `viewDidLoad` or any other view lifecycle methods, which come before `viewDidAppear`, simply set an Interaction path as shown below:

Swift:
```swift
override func viewDidLoad() {
    super.viewDidLoad()
    // Do any additional setup after loading the view
    self.oneInteractionPath = "/myCustomInteractionPath"
}
```


Objective-C:
```objective-c
- (void)viewDidLoad {
    [super viewDidLoad];
    // Do any additional setup after loading the view.
    self.oneInteractionPath = @"/myCustomInteractionPath";
}
```

*Note:*
- When setting the Interaction path programmatically please ensure the Interaction starts with a `/` and only contains letters, numbers and/or dashes.

### Exclude an Interaction

You can exclude a specific view controller from being recognized as an Interaction by using the `excludeInteractionPath` method.

In your `viewDidLoad` or any other view lifecycle methods, which come before the `viewDidAppear` method, simply set `excludeInteractionPath` to `true` as shown below:

Swift:
```swift
override func viewDidLoad() {
    super.viewDidLoad()
    // Do any additional setup after loading the view
    self.excludeInteractionPath = true
}
```

Objective-C:
```objective-c
- (void)viewDidLoad {    
    [super viewDidLoad];
    // Do any additional setup after loading the view.
    self.excludeInteractionPath = YES;
}
```

By default, `excludeInteractionPath` returns `false`.

### Disable automatic Interaction detection

You can disable automatic Interaction detection by calling the method `disableAutomaticInteractionDetection:` and passing `true` as a parameter, as shown below:

Swift:
```swift
One.disableAutomaticInteractionDetection(true)
```

Objective-C:
```objective-c
[One disableAutomaticInteractionDetection:YES];
```

An appropriate place to call the method might be under `didFinishLaunchingWithOptions` in your application delegate.

By disabling automatic Interaction detection, the SDK will no longer automatically send Interaction requests as view controllers are presented on screen. It becomes your responsibility to send them when needed by using the send Interaction methods outlined below.

You can set this back to false at any point to restart automatic Interaction detection.

### Send Interactions to Thunderhead ONE or Salesforce Interaction Studio

#### Send an Interaction request

You can send an Interaction request programmatically by calling the `sendInteraction` method and passing an Interaction path as a parameter as shown below:

Swift:
```swift
One.sendInteraction("/InteractionPath")
```

Objective-C:
```objective-c
[One sendInteraction:@"/InteractionPath"];
```

*Note:*
- This will send a POST request to Thunderhead ONE or Salesforce Interaction Studio. Only the tid from the response will be used by the SDK - all other response objects will be ignored.
- When sending Interaction requests programmatically please ensure the Interaction starts with a `/` and only contains letters, numbers and/or dashes.

#### Send an Interaction request and retrieve the response

You can send an Interaction request programmatically and retrieve its response by passing an Interaction path and a completion block as a parameters, as shown below:

Swift:
```swift
One.sendInteraction("/InteractionPath") { (response, error) -> Void in
    if (error == nil) {
        if let response = response {
            One.processResponse(response)
        }
    }
}
```

Objective-C:
```objective-c
[One sendInteraction:@"/InteractionPath" withBlock:^(NSDictionary *response, NSError *error) {
    if (!error) {
        [One processResponse:response];
    }
}];
```
The response can be passed to the `processResponse` method as a parameter, as shown above. This method returns the response to the SDK to process - attaching any capture, track or optimize instructions to the Interaction.

*Note:*
- This will send a `POST` request to Thunderhead ONE or Salesforce Interaction Studio.
- When sending Interaction requests programmatically please ensure the Interaction starts with a `/` and only contains letters, numbers and/or dashes.

### Retrieve a response for an automatically triggered Interaction request

You can retrieve a response for a specific automatically triggered Interaction request by adopting the `OneInteractionResponseDelegate` protocol.  Follow the instructions below in order to set up this functionality depending on the object’s class. 

This functionality will not work if [automatic Interaction detection is disabled](#disable-automatic-interaction-detection).  For retrieving the response in sending programmatic Interactions, see [Send an Interaction request and retrieve the response](#send-an-interaction-request-and-retrieve-the-response).

1. Adopt the `OneInteractionResponseDelegate` protocol in the class definition:

    Swift:
    ```swift
    class MyViewController: UIViewController, OneInteractionResponseDelegate 
    ```

    Objective-C:
    ```objective-c
    @interface MyViewController() <OneInteractionResponseDelegate>
    ```
    See example of usage [here](https://github.com/thunderheadone/one-sdk-ios/blob/master/examples/optimizing-programmatically-using-json-example/Content%20Orchestration%20Example/Content%20Orchestration%20Example/FirstViewController.swift#L15).

2. Set the `oneInteractionPath` value to the name of the Interaction you want to retrieve the response from, and assign the delegate.     

    * For `UIViewController` classes:

      Access the existing `oneInteractionPath` property and set its value to the name of the Interaction in `viewDidLoad`.

      Swift:
      ```swift
      override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        self.oneInteractionPath = "/InteractionPath"
        One.addInteractionResponseDelegate(self)
      }
      ```

      Objective-C:
      ```objective-c
      - (void)viewDidLoad {
        [super viewDidLoad];
        self.oneInteractionPath = @"/InteractionPath";
        [One addInteractionResponseDelegate:self];
      }
      ```

    * For custom classes:
      
      Declare the required `oneInteractionPath` string property and set its value to the name of the Interaction.
        
      Swift:
      ```swift
      class YourObject: YourObjectClass, OneInteractionResponseDelegate {
        var oneInteractionPath: String! = "/InteractionPath"
        ...

        func configureOneInteractionResponseDelegate() {
            One.addInteractionResponseDelegate(self)
        }
      }
      ```

      Objective-C:
      ```objective-c
      @implementation YourObjectClass

      - (void)configureOneInteractionResponseDelegate {
        self.oneInteractionPath = @"/InteractionPath";  
        [One addInteractionResponseDelegate:self];
      }
      ```

      See example of usage [here](https://github.com/thunderheadone/one-sdk-ios/blob/master/examples/optimizing-programmatically-using-json-example/Content%20Orchestration%20Example/Content%20Orchestration%20Example/FirstViewController.swift#L37).

      *Note:*
      - The SDK will weakly store your object, so you need to keep a strong reference to it somewhere.

4. Implement the protocol’s required method:

    Swift:
    ```swift
    func interaction(_ interactionPath: String!, didReceiveResponse response: [AnyHashable : Any]!) {
        if (response != nil) {
            // Work with the response.
            /* Pass on the response to Thunderhead SDK. This method returns the response to the SDK to process - attaching any capture, track or optimize instructions to the Interaction. */ 
            One.processResponse(response)
        }
    }
    ```

    Objective-C:
    ```objective-c
    - (void)interaction:(NSString *)interactionPath didReceiveResponse:(NSDictionary *)response {
        if (response) {
            // Work with the response.
            // Pass on the response to Thunderhead SDK. This method returns the response to the SDK to process - attaching any capture, track or optimize instructions to the Interaction.
            [One processResponse:response];
        }
    }
    ```
    The method returns an Interaction path and the corresponding Interaction response. You can process the response in the delegate callback. Once processed, pass the response using the `processResponse` method to let the SDK process the response - attaching any capture, track or optimize instructions to the Interaction. 

    See example of usage [here](https://github.com/thunderheadone/one-sdk-ios/blob/master/examples/optimizing-programmatically-using-json-example/Content%20Orchestration%20Example/Content%20Orchestration%20Example/FirstViewController.swift#L43).

5. If you no longer need to obtain response for automatically triggered Interaction request, you can either nullify your object or call the SDK’s method `removeInteractionResponseDelegate` as shown below:

    Swift:
    ```swift
    One.removeInteractionResponseDelegate(<your-object>)
    ```

    Objective-C:
    ```objective-c
    [One removeInteractionResponseDelegate:<your-object>];
    ```

### Send Properties to Thunderhead ONE or Salesforce Interaction Studio

Properties can be sent to Thunderhead ONE or Salesforce Interaction Studio as Strings, in the form of key/value pairs using the SDK's public methods, as shown below:

Swift:
```swift
let myProperties = ["key1":"value1","key2":"value2"]
```


Objective-C:
```objective-c
NSDictionary *myProperties = @{@"Key1":@"Value1", @"Key2":@"Value2"};
```

#### Send Properties to a base Touchpoint

To send Properties to a base Touchpoint, call the following public method and pass in your dictionary of key/value pair strings:

Swift:
```swift
One.sendBaseTouchpointProperties(myProperties)
```


Objective-C:
```objective-c
[One sendBaseTouchpointProperties:myProperties];
```

*Note:*
- This will send a PUT request to Thunderhead ONE or Salesforce Interaction Studio.
- Properties sent to a base Touchpoint will be captured under a base (`/`) or wildcard (`/*`) Interaction in Thunderhead ONE or Salesforce Interaction Studio.

#### Send Properties to an Interaction

To send Properties to a specific Interaction, call the following public method, passing in your dictionary of key/value pair strings and providing the Interaction path:

Swift:
```swift
One.sendProperties(myProperties, forInteractionPath:"/InteractionPath")
```


Objective-C:
```objective-c
[One sendProperties:myProperties forInteractionPath:@"/InteractionPath"];
```

*Note:*
- This will send a `PUT` request to Thunderhead ONE or Salesforce Interaction Studio.
- When sending Interaction requests programmatically, please ensure the Interaction starts with a `/` and only contains letters, numbers and/or dashes.

#### Send an Interaction request with Properties

You can send an Interaction request with Interaction Properties by calling the method below, passing Interaction path and dictionary of Properties to it:

Swift:
```swift
One.sendInteraction("/InteractionPath", withProperties:myProperties)
```


Objective-C:
```objective-c
[One sendInteraction:@"/InteractionPath" withProperties:myProperties];
```

*Note:*
- This will send a `POST` request to Thunderhead ONE or Salesforce Interaction Studio.
- Only the tid from the response will be used by the SDK - all other response objects will be ignored.
- When sending Interaction requests programmatically, please ensure the Interaction starts with a `/` and only contains letters, numbers and/or dashes.

#### Send an Interaction request with Properties and retrieve the response

You can send an Interaction request with Properties and retrieve its response by calling the method below, passing an Interaction path, a dictionary of Properties and a completion block to it:

Swift:
```swift
One.sendInteraction("/InteractionPath", withProperties:myProperties) {
    (response, error) in
        if (error == nil) {
            if let response = response {
                One.processResponse(response)
            }
        }
}
```


Objective-C:
```objective-c
[One sendInteraction:@"/InteractionPath" withProperties:myProperties andBlock:^(NSDictionary *response, NSError *error) {
    if (!error) {
        [One processResponse:response];
    }
}];
```

*Note:*
- This will send a POST request to Thunderhead ONE or Salesforce Interaction Studio.
- When sending Interaction requests programmatically, please ensure the Interaction starts with a `/` and only contains letters, numbers and/or dashes.

The response can be passed to the `processResponse` method as a parameter as shown above. This method returns the response to the SDK to process, attaching any capture, track or optimize instructions to the Interaction.

#### Send a response code

To send a response code, call the method shown below by passing the response code and the corresponding Interaction path as parameters:

Swift:
```swift
One.sendResponseCode("yourCode", forInteractionPath:"/InteractionPath")
```


Objective-C:
```objective-c
[One sendResponseCode:@"yourCode" forInteractionPath:@"/InteractionPath"];
```

*Note:*
- This method should be used when displaying Optimizations programmatically and you need to capture the user's response.
- This will send a `PUT` request to Thunderhead ONE or Salesforce Interaction Studio.
- When sending Interaction requests programmatically, please ensure the Interaction starts with a `/` and only contains letters, numbers and/or dashes.

### Identity sync

#### Identity sync with Thunderhead ONE or Salesforce Interaction Studio

To synchronise the Safari Mobile identity set by the ONE Tag, or Interaction Studio Tag, with the current app identity, call:

Swift:
```swift
One.identitySync()
```


Objective-C:
```objective-c
[One identitySync];
```

*Note:*
- This functionality only works in iOS 9 and 10.

#### Identity sync with Thunderhead ONE or Salesforce Interaction Studio and your web Touchpoint

To synchronise the Safari Mobile identity set by the ONE Tag, or Interaction Studio Tag, with the current app identity and your web Touchpoint, call:

Swift:
```swift
One.identitySyncWithURL(URL(string: "https://yourWebsite"))
```


Objective-C:
```objective-c
[One identitySyncWithURL:[NSURL URLWithString:@"https://yourwebsite"]];
```

*Note:*
- This functionality only works in iOS 9 and 10.

### Ability to whitelist identity transfer links

The SDK will append a `one-tid` url parameter to all links opened from a mobile app. If you would like to limit this behavior, for the SDK to only append a `one-tid` to a specific set of links, you can whitelist the links to which the SDK should append a `one-tid` by calling the method `whitelistIdentityTransferLinks` and passing your links as shown below:

Swift:
```swift
// This example shows how to whitelist links under specific domain names
// www.google.com and www.uber.com. For example,
// https://www.google.com, https://www.uber.com/en/,
// https://www.uber.com/en/ride/, etc.
One.whitelistIdentityTransferLinks(["www.google.com","www.uber.com"])

// This example shows how to whitelist the main domain name
// wikipedia.org and any subdomains. For example,
// https://en.wikipedia.org, https://simple.wikipedia.org, etc.
One.whitelistIdentityTransferLinks(["*.wikipedia.org"])
```


Objective-C:
```objective-c
// This example shows how to whitelist links for specific domain names
// www.google.com and www.uber.com. For example,
// https://www.google.com, https://www.uber.com/en/,
// https://www.uber.com/en/ride/, etc.
[One whitelistIdentityTransferLinks:@[@"www.google.com", @"www.uber.com"]];

// This example shows how to whitelist the main domain name
// wikipedia.org and any subdomain. For example,
// https://en.wikipedia.org, https://simple.wikipedia.org, etc.
[One whitelistIdentityTransferLinks:@[@"*.wikipedia.org"]];
```

*Note:*
- When a link is whitelisted, a `one-tid` will be appended to the whitelisted link/s only.

### Ability to blacklist identity transfer links

The SDK will append a `one-tid` url parameter to all links opened from a mobile app. If you would like to limit this behaviour, for the SDK to only append a `one-tid` specific set of links, you can blacklist the links to which the SDK should not append a `one-tid` by calling the method `blacklistIdentityTransferLinks` and passing your links as shown below:

Swift:
```swift
// This example shows how to blacklist links under specific domain names
// www.google.com and www.uber.com. For example,
// https://www.google.com, https://www.uber.com/en/,
// https://www.uber.com/en/ride/, etc.
One.blacklistIdentityTransferLinks(["www.google.com","www.uber.com"])

// This example shows how to blacklist the main domain name
// wikipedia.org and any subdomain. For example,
// https://en.wikipedia.org, https://simple.wikipedia.org, etc.
One.blacklistIdentityTransferLinks(["*.wikipedia.org"])
```


Objective-C:
```objective-c
// This example shows how to blacklist links under specific domain names
// www.google.com and www.uber.com. For example,
// https://www.google.com, https://www.uber.com/en-BY/,
// https://www.uber.com/en/ride/, etc.
[One blacklistIdentityTransferLinks :@[@"www.google.com", @"www.uber.com"]];

// This example shows how to blacklist the main domain name
// wikipedia.org and any subdomain. For example,
// https://en.wikipedia.org, https://simple.wikipedia.org, etc.
[One blacklistIdentityTransferLinks:@[@"*.wikipedia.org"]];
```

*Note:*
- If a link is blacklisted, a `one-tid` will be appended to all other links but the blacklisted link.

###    Disable automatic identity transfer

By default, the SDK adds `one-tid` as a URL query parameter to outgoing network requests. To disable it, call the method `disableIdentityTransfer` by passing `true` as shown below:

Swift:
```swift
One.disableIdentityTransfer(true)
```


Objective-C:
```objective-c
[One disableIdentityTransfer:YES];
```

*Note:*
- This will also disable the ability to automatically pick up parameters from deep links that open the app, whilst also preventing the SDK from adding a `one-tid` as a URL query parameter to web links opened from the app, resulting in the customer's identity not being transferred as they move across channels.

#### Send Properties for a URL scheme

If you have disabled automatic identity transfer you can still send all URL parameters received as part of a URL scheme, which opens your app, by calling:

Swift:
```swift
One.handleURL(yourNSURL)
```


Objective-C:
```objective-c
[One handleURL:yourNSURL];
```

passing the URL as a parameter into the handleURL SDK public method, as shown below:

Swift:
```swift
func application(app: UIApplication, openURL url: NSURL, options: [String : AnyObject]) -> Bool  {
    One.handleURL(yourNSURL)
    return true
}
```


Objective-C:
```objective-c
- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application handleOpenURL:(NSURL *)url {
    [One handleURL:url];
    return YES;
}
```
*Note:*
- This will send a PUT request to Thunderhead ONE or Salesforce Interaction Studio.

#### Append a `one-tid` parameter to a `NSURL` to facilitate identity transfer

If you have disabled automatic identity transfer, you can still add a `one-tid` parameter to a link opened from the app programmatically, by calling `getURLWithOneTid` as shown below:

Swift:
```swift
One.getURLWithOneTid(yourNSURL)
```


Objective-C:
```objective-c
[One getURLWithOneTid:yourNSURL];
```

passing the URL as a parameter, which will return back a the same `NSURL` containing a `one-tid` parameter.

Swift:
```swift
let urlWithOneTid = One.getURLWithOneTid(yourNSURL)
```


Objective-C:
```objective-c
NSURL *urlWithOneTid = [One getURLWithOneTid:yourNSURL];
```

### Disable automatic outbound link tracking

By default, the SDK will automatically send an Interaction request to `/one-click` as a url is opened in Safari, `SafariViewController` or `WKWebView` to facilitate last click attribution.

To disable this functionality call the `disableAutomaticOutboundLinkTracking` method and pass `true`, as shown below:

Swift:
```swift
One.disableAutomaticOutboundLinkTracking(true)
```


Objective-C:
```objective-c
[One disableAutomaticOutboundLinkTracking:YES];
```

#### Programmatically trigger an outbound link tracking Interaction call

If you have disabled automatic outbound link tracking, you can still track a URL, by calling:

Swift:
```swift
One.sendInteractionForOutboundLink(yourNSURL)
```


Objective-C:
```objective-c
[One sendInteractionForOutboundLink:yourNSURL];
```

passing the URL which will send an Interaction request ‘/one-click’ using the same logic as available automatically.

*Note:*
- This will send a POST request to Thunderhead ONE or Salesforce Interaction Studio.


### Send a location object

To send a location object, call:

Swift:
```swift
One.updateLocation(location)
```


Objective-C:
```objective-c
[One updateLocation:location];
```

passing the location object as a parameter to the `updateLocation` method. Use `CLLocationManager` delegate methods to call `updateLocation`, as shown below:

Swift:
```swift
func locationManager(manager: CLLocationManager, didUpdateLocations locations: [CLLocation]) {
    One.updateLocation(locations.first)
}
```


Objective-C:
```objective-c
- (void)locationManager:(CLLocationManager *)manager didUpdateLocations:(NSArray *)locations {
    [One updateLocation:[locations firstObject]];
}
```

### Get a structure data

*Please note this API has been deprecated in version 7.0.0 of the iOS SDK. If you require this API please contact [support@thunderhead.com](mailto:support@thunderhead.com).*

To get a structure data, call `getStructureData` method by passing a structure’s name and a completion block as shown below:

Swift:
```swift
One.getStructureData("yourStructureName") { (response, error) in
    if (error == nil) {
        // work with response
    }
}
```


Objective-C:
```objective-c
[One getStructureData:@"yourStructureName" withBlock:^(NSDictionary *response, NSError *error) {
    if (!error) {
        // work with response
    }
}];
```

### Get Tid

To get the current `tid` used by the SDK, call:

Swift:
```swift
One.getTid
```


Objective-C:
```objective-c
[One getTid];
```

*Note:*
- This will return the `tid` assigned to the current user as a `NSString`.
- Retrieving the current `tid` can be useful if you want to monitor the current user in Thunderhead ONE or Salesforce Interaction Studio.
- The tid can also be used if you need to pass the identity of the current user to another system which sends data to Thunderhead ONE or Salesforce Interaction Studio.

### Get current configuration

To get the current configuration of the SDK, call:

Swift: 
```swift
let currentConfiguration = OneConfiguration.currentConfiguration()
let siteKey = currentConfiguration?.siteKey

// To access configuration properties, you can also call:
let siteKey = OneConfiguration.shared().siteKey
```

Objective-C:
```objective-c
OneConfiguration *currentConfiguration = [OneConfiguration currentConfiguration];
NSString *siteKey = currentConfiguration.siteKey;

// To access configuration properties, you can also call:
NSString *siteKey = [OneConfiguration shared].siteKey;
```

*Note:*
- Retrieving the current configuration can be useful to validate your setup, especially if you have multiple configurations in an app.  

### Access debug information

The Thunderhead SDK for iOS provides 5 distinct debugging levels, that can be enabled in the `didFinishLaunchingWithOptions` method of your project's AppDelegate, as shown below:

*Note:* All Thunderhead SDK log messages will be prefixed with `[Thunderhead]` in the console.

1. `kOneLogLevelNone` - if set, no messages will be displayed in the console.

    Swift:
    ```swift
    One.setLogLevel(.None)
    ```


    Objective-C:
    ```objective-c
    [One setLogLevel:kOneLogLevelNone];
    ```

2. `kOneLogLevelAll` - if set, all log messages will be displayed in the console.

    Swift:
    ```swift
    One.setLogLevel(.All)
    ```


    Objective-C:
    ```objective-c
    [One setLogLevel:kOneLogLevelAll];
    ```

3. `kOneLogLevelWebService` - if set, only web service logs will be displayed in the console.

    Swift:
    ```swift
    One.setLogLevel(.WebService)
    ```


    Objective-C:
    ```objective-c
    [One setLogLevel:kOneLogLevelWebService];
    ```

4. `kOneLogLevelFramework` - if set, only framework logs will be displayed in the console.

    Swift:
    ```swift
    One.setLogLevel(.Framework)
    ```


    Objective-C:
    ```objective-c
    [One setLogLevel:kOneLogLevelFramework];
    ```
    
5. `kOneLogLevelDebug` - if set, only debug logs will be displayed in the console.

    Swift:
    ```swift
    One.setLogLevel(.Debug)
    ```


    Objective-C:
    ```objective-c
    [One setLogLevel:kOneLogLevelDebug];
    ```

*Note:*
- By default, the Thunderhead SDK for iOS does not display any debug log messages. However, exception messages are printed in the console, when these occur.

### Identify the framework version

You can find out the current version of the framework by calling:

Swift:
```swift
One.frameworkVersion()
```


Objective-C:
```objective-c
[One frameworkVersion];
```

### Clear the user profile

You can programmatically erase the user profile data by calling:

Swift:
```swift
One.clearUserProfile()
```


Objective-C:
```objective-c
[One clearUserProfile];
```

*Note:*
- This method removes `tid` from local storage only.
- For instructions on how to completely remove a user's data from Thunderhead ONE or Salesforce Interaction Studio - see our [api documentation](https://thunderheadone.github.io/one-api/#operation/delete).
