    This example app demonstrates how to late initialize and reconfigure the ONE SDK when required.
       In this app, we use the situation where it may be useful to reconfigure the SDK
       in the event that a user has changed regions.

         Late Initialization, put off configuration until later.
         
         You can initialize the SDK with either all valid or empty/nil parameters.
         - When initialized with valid credentials, the SDK can be reconfigured later when necessary.
         - When initialized by passing all `empty strings` or `nil` parameters (late initialization), the SDK can then be configured with valid parameters later using the same method.
             - Note: In this state, the SDK locally queues end-user data and will upload the data to server once SDK is initialized with valid parameters.
