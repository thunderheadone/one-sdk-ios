## Requirements

The Thunderhead SDK for iOS supports iOS 9.0 and above.

### iOS version requirements

+ iOS minimum version (deployment target): iOS 9.0
+ iOS base SDK version: iOS 14.3

### Xcode version requirements

+ Xcode minimum version: 12.0

*Note:*
- Xcode versions < 12.0 only support archiving an application with bitcode disabled.

## Installation

The Thunderhead SDK can be integrated via [Swift Package Manager](#swift-package-manager), [CocoaPods](#cocoapods) or [by manually adding it to your project](#manual-installation).

### Swift Package Manager

Adding a binary Swift package into your project can be done directly in Xcode in a few simple steps:

1. Add the package dependency into your Xcode project. 

   To do so, in the Xcode Navigation Bar, go to File > Swift Packages > Add Package Dependency… You might need to select your project in the next window if there are multiple projects in your workspace. 
 
   Now enter the package repository URL provided below into the search field and hit Next.

   ```sh
   https://github.com/thunderheadone/one-sdk-ios
   ```

   ![Thunderhead Add Package](https://github.com/thunderheadone/one-sdk-ios/raw/master/images/SPM/ThunderheadAddPackageURL.png)

2. Select additional options such as a specific version number, branch or commit identifier. 

   By default, Up to Next Major version is selected. We recommend using the latest version of the Thunderhead SDK for iOS, which you can find [here](https://github.com/thunderheadone/one-sdk-ios/releases). 

   To integrate a specific version of the Thunderhead SDK, simply specify a version number you need. 

   For example, to integrate version 6.0.0 of the Thunderhead SDK, specify the version number like on the screenshot below:

   ![Thunderhead Choose Package Version](https://github.com/thunderheadone/one-sdk-ios/raw/master/images/SPM/ThunderheadChoosePackage.png)

3. Wait for Xcode to finish downloading and resolving the Swift package into your project.

   ![Thunderhead Cloning Package](https://github.com/thunderheadone/one-sdk-ios/raw/master/images/SPM/ThunderheadFetchPackage.png)

4. Choose the package products and targets.

   ![Thunderhead Select Target](https://github.com/thunderheadone/one-sdk-ios/raw/master/images/SPM/ThunderheadSelectTarget.png)

5. Drag and drop the **_ThunderheadBundle.bundle_** to **Copy Bundle Resources** section in your targets.

   ![Thunderhead Copy Thunderhead Bundle](https://github.com/thunderheadone/one-sdk-ios/raw/master/images/SPM/ThunderheadAddBundleResource.gif)

### CocoaPods

Make sure you have the [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org) dependency manager installed. You can do so by executing the following command:

```sh
$ gem install cocoapods
```

Specify the *Thunderhead SDK* in your podfile.

```txt
# Thunderhead SDK
    target :YourTargetName do
    pod 'Thunderhead', '~> 6.0.0'
    end
```

Install using the following command:

```sh
$ pod install
```

You can find an example project for pod installation [here](https://github.com/thunderheadone/one-sdk-ios/tree/master/examples/dynamic-initialization-example).

*Note:*
- While running `pod install`, if you get the following warnings:

```txt
[!] The `ThunderheadSampleApp [Debug]` target overrides the `OTHER_LDFLAGS` build setting defined in `Pods/Target Support Files/Pods-ThunderheadSampleApp/Pods-ThunderheadSampleApp.debug.xcconfig'. This can lead to problems with the CocoaPods installation
    - Use the `$(inherited)` flag, or
    - Remove the build settings from the target.
[!] The `ThunderheadSampleApp [Release]` target overrides the `OTHER_LDFLAGS` build setting defined in `Pods/Target Support Files/Pods-ThunderheadSampleApp/Pods-ThunderheadSampleApp.release.xcconfig'. This can lead to problems with the CocoaPods installation
    - Use the `$(inherited)` flag, or
    - Remove the build settings from the target.
```

Go to app target's **Build Settings**, add **$(inherited)** to **Other Linker Flags**, which will add linker flags generated in pods or see our [Troubleshooting Guide](TROUBLESHOOTING-GUIDE.md#resolve-undefined-symbols-for-architecture-arm64-compile-time-error).


### Manual installation

1. [Download the latest Thunderhead SDK for iOS](https://github.com/thunderheadone/one-sdk-ios/releases) and extract the zip.
2. Open your existing iOS application Xcode project.
3. Import the Thunderhead.embeddedframework into your project.
4. Confirm the SDK files have been added to your project, as follows:
    + Navigate to your project build settings by selecting your project's Project File in the Project Navigator.
    + Select the main build target for your app.
    + Select the **Build Phases** tab.
    + Confirm **_Thunderhead.xcframework_** is located in the **Link Binary With Libraries** section.
    + Confirm **_ThunderheadBundle.bundle_** is located in the **Copy Bundle Resources** section.
5. Ensure your project enables modules by going to **Build Settings** tab and setting the flag for **Enable Modules (C and Objective-C)** to **Yes**. Check out **_Adding the SDK dependencies for manual installation_** if you need modules to be disabled.

See example project for manual installation [here](https://github.com/thunderheadone/one-sdk-ios/tree/master/examples/optimizing-programmatically-using-json-example).

*Note:*
- If you encounter the `No such module 'Thunderhead'` compile error, see our [Troubleshooting Guide](TROUBLESHOOTING-GUIDE.md#no-such-module-thunderhead-xcode-compile-error).

#### Adding the SDK dependencies for manual installation

The SDK requires modules to be enabled. If you require modules to be disabled, you may need to include the following frameworks to the **Link Binary With Libraries**:

+ *Accelerate.framework*
+ *CoreLocation.framework*
+ *Foundation.framework*
+ *LocalAuthentication.framework*
+ *CoreGraphics.framework*
+ *MessageUI.framework*
+ *SafariServices.framework*
+ *Security.framework*
+ *SystemConfiguration.framework*
+ *UIKit.framework*
+ *WebKit.framework*
+ *libsqlite3.tbd*

*Note:*
- If any of the frameworks are missing from your app, select the +icon in the lower-left corner of the **Link Binary With Libraries** section and add each framework, as needed, using the popup window.

#### Biometric authentication

The SDK supports biometric authentication (Touch ID / Face ID) in Admin mode

*Note:*
- To use Face ID authentication, you need to add:

```
<key>NSFaceIDUsageDescription</key>
<string>Why is my app authenticating using face id?</string>
```

to your `Info.plist` file. Failure to do so results in a dialog that tells the user your app has not provided the Face ID usage description.

## Configure the codeless Thunderhead SDK for iOS

Enable your app to automatically recognize **Interactions** in your app, by executing the following steps:

### Initialize the SDK

Complete the following steps to initialize the SDK.

#### Import the SDK’s module
1.    Open your App Delegate file.
2.    Add the following line at the top of the file below your own import statements:

    Swift:
    ```swift
    import Thunderhead
    ```

    Objective-C:
    ```objective-c
    @import Thunderhead;
    ```

#### Set up the SDK in User mode for App Store builds

To start tracking, capturing, and receiving Optimizations with the Thunderhead SDK in User mode, you must first initialize it with your Thunderhead API parameters. You can find your Thunderhead API parameters on the Thunderhead ONE website or in Salesforce Interaction Studio.

With your parameters ready at hand, add the following lines to the top of the `didFinishLaunchingWithOptions`:

Swift:
```swift
One.startSessionWithSK("ONE-XXXXXXXXXX-1022",
                    uri:"myAppsNameURI",
                 apiKey:"f713d44a-8af0-4e79-ba7e-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
           sharedSecret:"bb8bacb2-ffc2-4c52-aaf4-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
                 userId:"api@yourCompanyName",
              adminMode:false,
               hostName:"eu2.thunderhead.com")
```


Objective-C:
```objective-c
[One startSessionWithSK:@"ONE-XXXXXXXXXX-1022"
                    uri:@"myAppsNameURI"
                 apiKey:@"f713d44a-8af0-4e79-ba7e-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
           sharedSecret:@"bb8bacb2-ffc2-4c52-aaf4-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
                 userId:@"api@yourCompanyName"
              adminMode:NO
               hostName:@"eu2.thunderhead.com"];
```

#### Set up the SDK in Admin mode for internal distribution

To use the framework in Admin mode, simply change the `adminMode` boolean to `true`, as follows:

Swift:
```swift
One.startSessionWithSK("ONE-XXXXXXXXXX-1022",
                    uri:"myAppsNameURI",
                 apiKey:"f713d44a-8af0-4e79-ba7e-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
           sharedSecret:"bb8bacb2-ffc2-4c52-aaf4-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
                 userId:"api@yourCompanyName",
              adminMode:true,
               hostName:"eu2.thunderhead.com")
```


Objective-C:
```objective-c
[One startSessionWithSK:@"ONE-XXXXXXXXXX-1022"
                    uri:@"myAppsNameURI"
                 apiKey:@"f713d44a-8af0-4e79-ba7e-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
           sharedSecret:@"bb8bacb2-ffc2-4c52-aaf4-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
                 userId:@"api@yourCompanyName"
              adminMode:YES
               hostName:@"eu2.thunderhead.com"];
```

**You have now successfully integrated the codeless Thunderhead SDK for iOS.**

### Further codeless integration considerations

#### For Salesforce Interaction Studio integrations

When integrating with Salesforce Interaction Studio you can set the Admin mode theme to match the Interaction Studio look and feel, as follows:

Swift:
```swift
One.setTheme(OneTheme.InteractionStudio)
```

Objective-C:
```objective-c
 [One setTheme:OneThemeInteractionStudio];
```
*Note:*
- By default the SDK will be launched using the Thunderhead ONE theme. You should only use the Interaction Studio theme if you are a Salesforce customer.

#### `ViewController`/`View` lifecycle overriding rules

The framework listens to a number of `UIViewController` and `UIView` methods to provide the desired functionality. Those methods are:
- `viewWillAppear`
- `viewDidAppear`
- `viewWillDisappear`
- `didMoveToWindow`

If you use these methods in your code, please ensure to call super when implementing them.

#### Sending codeless Interactions based on the list of Interactions created under a Touchpoint

In order to reduce the number of unnecessary Interaction requests sent automatically by the SDK, only codeless Interactions with explicit Interaction paths created under a Touchpoint and configured with at least one point are sent to Thunderhead ONE or Salesforce Interaction Studio. This configuration change has been introduced in version 5.3.0 of the iOS SDK.

*Note:*
- The SDK will only send codeless Interactions if they have been created under a Touchpoint and/or if they match wildcard rules defined under a Touchpoint.
- For a codeless Interaction to be sent by the SDK this Interaction needs to contain at least one Activity Capture Point, Attribute Capture Point, and/or Optimization Point.
- If you are running the SDK in [User mode](#set-up-the-sdk-in-user-mode-for-app-store-builds), you need to ensure that all Interactions and related points have been fully published, before the SDK will trigger a request.

## Additional features
Follow any of the steps below to access further functions of the SDK. 

You will typically use these functions to extend the codeless functionality, turn off specific codeless functions or if you are adopting a pure programmatic integration. 

### Opt an end-user out of or into tracking
The following methods allow you to opt a user out of various levels of tracking and also opt them back in based on your app's privacy configuration.

*Note:*
- By default all `opt` options are set to `opt:In`.

#### Opt an end-user out/in of all tracking
Use this option to opt an end-user out or in of all tracking.

##### Opt an end-user out of all tracking
To opt out an end-user from all tracking when the end-user does not give permission to be tracked in the client app, call the opt out method as shown below:

Swift:
```swift
One.opt(.out, forOptions: .allTracking)
```

Objective-C:
```objective-c
[One opt:Out forOptions:AllTracking];
```

*Note:*
- When you opt out a user from all tracking all of the other opt out options will be also opted out, tracking will stop and locally queued data will be removed.
- For instructions on how to completely remove a user's data from Thunderhead ONE or Salesforce Interaction Studio - see our [api documentation](https://thunderheadone.github.io/one-api/#operation/delete).

##### Opt an end-user in for all tracking
To opt in an end-user for all tracking when the end-user gives permission to be tracked in the client app, call the opt in method as shown below:

Swift:
```swift
One.opt(.in, forOptions: .allTracking)
```

Objective-C:
```objective-c
[One opt:In forOptions:AllTracking];
```

#### Opt an end-user out/in of all keychain Tid storage
Use this option to opt an end-user out or in of all keychain Tid storage.

##### Opt an end-user out of all keychain Tid storage
To opt out an end-user of all keychain Tid storage, call the opt method as shown below:

Swift:
```swift
One.opt(.out, forOptions: .keychainTidStorage)
```

Objective-C:
```objective-c
[One opt:Out forOptions:KeychainTidStorage];
```

##### Opt an end-user in for all keychain Tid storage

```

Objective-C:
```objective-c
[One opt:Out forOptions:PasteboardTidStorage];
```

##### Opt an end-user in for all pasteboard Tid storage
To opt in an end-user for all pasteboard Tid storage, call the opt method as shown below:

Swift:
```swift
One.opt(.in, forOptions: .pasteboardTidStorage)
```

Objective-C:
```objective-c
[One opt:In forOptions:PasteboardTidStorage];
```

#### Opt an end-user out/in of city/country level tracking

```objective-c
[One opt:In forOptions:CityCountryDetection];
```

#### Partial opt out/in example
To opt out an end-user of keychain Tid storage, pasteboard Tid storage and city/country level tracking but not of all tracking, use the following example:

Swift:
```swift
One.opt(.out, forOptions: .keychainTidStorage, .pasteboardTidStorage, .cityCountryDetection)
```

Objective-C:
```objective-c
[One opt:Out forOptions:KeychainTidStorage | PasteboardTidStorage | CityCountryDetection];
```

To opt in an end-user for all tracking, keychain Tid storage and city/country level tracking but not `pasteboardTidStorage`, use the following example:

Swift:

One.opt(.in, forOptions: .allTracking, .keychainTidStorage, .cityCountryDetection)
```
Objective-C:
```objective-c
[One opt:In forOptions:AllTracking | KeychainTidStorage | CityCountryDetection];
```

*Note:*
- When opted out, tracking will stop and locally queued data will be removed.
- For instructions on how to completely remove a user's data from Thunderhead ONE or Salesforce Interaction Studio - see our [api documentation](https://thunderheadone.github.io/one-api/#operation/delete).

### Disable in-list Optimizations

To disable in-list Optimizations, add the following to your app’s Info.plist file and set `DisableInListOptimization` to `YES` (boolean value).

![Thunderhead Config App's Info.plist file](https://github.com/thunderheadone/one-sdk-ios/raw/master/images/ThunderheadConfigInfoPlistEntry.png)

```xml
<key>Thunderhead Config</key>
<dict>
  <key>Swizzling Options</key>
  <dict>
    <key>DisableInListOptimization</key>
    <true/>
  </dict>
</dict>
``` 

### Late initialization and reconfiguration of the SDK

Need to late initialize or reconfigure the SDK to support multiple regions in your app? - see details [here](https://github.com/thunderheadone/one-sdk-ios/tree/master/examples/dynamic-initialization-example).

### Manually set a specific Interaction path

The SDK automatically assigns an Interaction path to each view controller. To override the Interaction path that is created automatically, call your view controller and pass your desired Interaction path as a string to the view controller’s `oneInteractionPath` property.

In your `viewDidLoad` or any other view lifecycle methods, which come before `viewDidAppear`, simply set an Interaction path as shown below:

Swift:
```swift
override func viewDidLoad() {
    super.viewDidLoad()
    // Do any additional setup after loading the view
    self.oneInteractionPath = "/myCustomInteractionPath"
}
```


Objective-C:
```objective-c
- (void)viewDidLoad {
    [super viewDidLoad];
    // Do any additional setup after loading the view.
    self.oneInteractionPath = @"/myCustomInteractionPath";
}
```

*Note:*
- When setting the Interaction path programmatically please ensure the Interaction starts with a `/` and only contains letters, numbers and/or dashes.

### Exclude an Interaction

You can exclude a specific view controller from being recognized as an Interaction by using the `excludeInteractionPath` method.

In your `viewDidLoad` or any other view lifecycle methods, which come before the `viewDidAppear` method, simply set `excludeInteractionPath` to `true` as shown below:

Swift:
```swift
override func viewDidLoad() {
    super.viewDidLoad()
    // Do any additional setup after loading the view
    self.excludeInteractionPath = true
}
```

Objective-C:
```objective-c
- (void)viewDidLoad {    
    [super viewDidLoad];
    // Do any additional setup after loading the view.
    self.excludeInteractionPath = YES;
}
```

By default, `excludeInteractionPath` returns `false`.

### Disable automatic Interaction detection

You can disable automatic Interaction detection by calling the method `disableAutomaticInteractionDetection:` and passing `true` as a parameter, as shown below:

Swift:
```swift
One.disableAutomaticInteractionDetection(true)
```

Objective-C:
```objective-c
[One disableAutomaticInteractionDetection:YES];
```

An appropriate place to call the method might be under `didFinishLaunchingWithOptions` in your application delegate.

By disabling automatic Interaction detection, the SDK will no longer automatically send Interaction requests as view controllers are presented on screen. It becomes your responsibility to send them when needed by using the send Interaction methods outlined below.

You can set this back to false at any point to restart automatic Interaction detection.

### Send Interactions to Thunderhead ONE or Salesforce Interaction Studio

#### Send an Interaction request

You can send an Interaction request programmatically by calling the `sendInteraction` method and passing an Interaction path as a parameter as shown below:

Swift:
```swift
One.sendInteraction("/InteractionPath")
```

Objective-C:
```objective-c
[One sendInteraction:@"/InteractionPath"];
```

*Note:*
- This will send a POST request to Thunderhead ONE or Salesforce Interaction Studio. Only the tid from the response will be used by the SDK - all other response objects will be ignored.
- When sending Interaction requests programmatically please ensure the Interaction starts with a `/` and only contains letters, numbers and/or dashes.

#### Send an Interaction request and retrieve the response

You can send an Interaction request programmatically and retrieve its response by passing an Interaction path and a completion block as a parameters, as shown below:

Swift:
```swift
One.sendInteraction("/InteractionPath") { (response, error) -> Void in
    if (error == nil) {
        if let response = response {
            One.processResponse(response)
        }
    }
}
```

Objective-C:
```objective-c
[One sendInteraction:@"/InteractionPath" withBlock:^(NSDictionary *response, NSError *error) {
    if (!error) {
        [One processResponse:response];
    }
}];
```
The response can be passed to the `processResponse` method as a parameter, as shown above. This method returns the response to the SDK to process - attaching any capture, track or optimize instructions to the Interaction.

*Note:*
- This will send a `POST` request to Thunderhead ONE or Salesforce Interaction Studio.
- When sending Interaction requests programmatically please ensure the Interaction starts with a `/` and only contains letters, numbers and/or dashes.

### Retrieve a response for an automatically triggered Interaction request

You can retrieve a response for a specific automatically triggered Interaction request by adopting the `OneInteractionResponseDelegate` protocol.  Follow the instructions below in order to set up this functionality depending on the object’s class. 

This functionality will not work if [automatic Interaction detection is disabled](https://github.com/thunderheadone/one-sdk-ios#disable-automatic-interaction-detection).  For retrieving the response in sending programmatic Interactions, see [Send an Interaction request and retrieve the response](https://github.com/thunderheadone/one-sdk-ios#send-an-interaction-request-and-retrieve-the-response).

1. Adopt the `OneInteractionResponseDelegate` protocol in the class definition:

    Swift:
    ```swift
    class MyViewController: UIViewController, OneInteractionResponseDelegate 
    ```

    Objective-C:
    ```objective-c
    @interface MyViewController() <OneInteractionResponseDelegate>
    ```
    See example of usage [here](https://github.com/thunderheadone/one-sdk-ios/blob/master/examples/optimizing-programmatically-using-json-example/Content%20Orchestration%20Example/Content%20Orchestration%20Example/FirstViewController.swift#L15).

2. Set the `oneInteractionPath` value to the name of the Interaction you want to retrieve the response from, and assign the delegate.     

    * For `UIViewController` classes:

      Access the existing `oneInteractionPath` property and set its value to the name of the Interaction in `viewDidLoad`.

      Swift:
      ```swift
      override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        self.oneInteractionPath = "/InteractionPath"
        One.addInteractionResponseDelegate(self)
      }
      ```

      Objective-C:
      ```objective-c
      - (void)viewDidLoad {
        [super viewDidLoad];
        self.oneInteractionPath = @"/InteractionPath";
        [One addInteractionResponseDelegate:self];
      }
      ```

    * For custom classes:
      
      Declare the required `oneInteractionPath` string property and set its value to the name of the Interaction.
        
      Swift:
      ```swift
      class YourObject: YourObjectClass, OneInteractionResponseDelegate {
        var oneInteractionPath: String! = "/InteractionPath"
        ...

        func configureOneInteractionResponseDelegate() {
            One.addInteractionResponseDelegate(self)
        }
      }
      ```

      Objective-C:
      ```objective-c
      @implementation YourObjectClass

      - (void)configureOneInteractionResponseDelegate {
        self.oneInteractionPath = @"/InteractionPath";  
        [One addInteractionResponseDelegate:self];
      }
      ```

      See example of usage [here](https://github.com/thunderheadone/one-sdk-ios/blob/master/examples/optimizing-programmatically-using-json-example/Content%20Orchestration%20Example/Content%20Orchestration%20Example/FirstViewController.swift#L37).

      *Note:*
      - The SDK will weakly store your object, so you need to keep a strong reference to it somewhere.

4. Implement the protocol’s required method:

    Swift:
    ```swift
    func interaction(_ interactionPath: String!, didReceiveResponse response: [AnyHashable : Any]!) {
        if (response != nil) {
            // Work with the response.
            /* Pass on the response to Thunderhead SDK. This method returns the response to the SDK to process - attaching any capture, track or optimize instructions to the Interaction. */ 
            One.processResponse(response)
        }
    }
    ```

    Objective-C:
    ```objective-c
    - (void)interaction:(NSString *)interactionPath didReceiveResponse:(NSDictionary *)response {
        if (response) {
            // Work with the response.
            // Pass on the response to Thunderhead SDK. This method returns the response to the SDK to process - attaching any capture, track or optimize instructions to the Interaction.
            [One processResponse:response];
        }
    }
    ```
    The method returns an Interaction path and the corresponding Interaction response. You can process the response in the delegate callback. Once processed, pass the response using the `processResponse` method to let the SDK process the response - attaching any capture, track or optimize instructions to the Interaction. 

    See example of usage [here](https://github.com/thunderheadone/one-sdk-ios/blob/master/examples/optimizing-programmatically-using-json-example/Content%20Orchestration%20Example/Content%20Orchestration%20Example/FirstViewController.swift#L43).

5. If you no longer need to obtain response for automatically triggered Interaction request, you can either nullify your object or call the SDK’s method `removeInteractionResponseDelegate` as shown below:

    Swift:
    ```swift
    One.removeInteractionResponseDelegate(<your-object>)
    ```

    Objective-C:
    ```objective-c
    [One removeInteractionResponseDelegate:<your-object>];
    ```

### Send Properties to Thunderhead ONE or Salesforce Interaction Studio

Properties can be sent to Thunderhead ONE or Salesforce Interaction Studio as Strings, in the form of key/value pairs using the SDK's public methods, as shown below:

Swift:
```swift
let myProperties = ["key1":"value1","key2":"value2"]
```


Objective-C:
```objective-c
NSDictionary *myProperties = @{@"Key1":@"Value1", @"Key2":@"Value2"};
```

#### Send Properties to a base Touchpoint

To send Properties to a base Touchpoint, call the following public method and pass in your dictionary of key/value pair strings:

Swift:
```swift
One.sendBaseTouchpointProperties(myProperties)
```


Objective-C:
```objective-c
[One sendBaseTouchpointProperties:myProperties];
```

*Note:*
- This will send a PUT request to Thunderhead ONE or Salesforce Interaction Studio.
- Properties sent to a base Touchpoint will be captured under a base (`/`) or wildcard (`/*`) Interaction in Thunderhead ONE or Salesforce Interaction Studio.

#### Send Properties to an Interaction

To send Properties to a specific Interaction, call the following public method, passing in your dictionary of key/value pair strings and providing the Interaction path:

Swift:
```swift
One.sendProperties(myProperties, forInteractionPath:"/InteractionPath")
```


Objective-C:
```objective-c
[One sendProperties:myProperties forInteractionPath:@"/InteractionPath"];
```

*Note:*
- This will send a `PUT` request to Thunderhead ONE or Salesforce Interaction Studio.
- When sending Interaction requests programmatically, please ensure the Interaction starts with a `/` and only contains letters, numbers and/or dashes.

#### Send an Interaction request with Properties

You can send an Interaction request with Interaction Properties by calling the method below, passing Interaction path and dictionary of Properties to it:

Swift:
```swift
One.sendInteraction("/InteractionPath", withProperties:myProperties)
```


Objective-C:
```objective-c
[One sendInteraction:@"/InteractionPath" withProperties:myProperties];
```

*Note:*
- This will send a `POST` request to Thunderhead ONE or Salesforce Interaction Studio.
- Only the tid from the response will be used by the SDK - all other response objects will be ignored.
- When sending Interaction requests programmatically, please ensure the Interaction starts with a `/` and only contains letters, numbers and/or dashes.

#### Send an Interaction request with Properties and retrieve the response

You can send an Interaction request with Properties and retrieve its response by calling the method below, passing an Interaction path, a dictionary of Properties and a completion block to it:

Swift:
```swift
One.sendInteraction("/InteractionPath", withProperties:myProperties) {
    (response, error) in
        if (error == nil) {
            if let response = response {
                One.processResponse(response)
            }
        }
}
```


Objective-C:
```objective-c
[One sendInteraction:@"/InteractionPath" withProperties:myProperties andBlock:^(NSDictionary *response, NSError *error) {
    if (!error) {
        [One processResponse:response];
    }
}];
```

*Note:*
- This will send a POST request to Thunderhead ONE or Salesforce Interaction Studio.
- When sending Interaction requests programmatically, please ensure the Interaction starts with a `/` and only contains letters, numbers and/or dashes.

The response can be passed to the `processResponse` method as a parameter as shown above. This method returns the response to the SDK to process, attaching any capture, track or optimize instructions to the Interaction.

#### Send a response code

To send a response code, call the method shown below by passing the response code and the corresponding Interaction path as parameters:

Swift:
```swift
One.sendResponseCode("yourCode", forInteractionPath:"/InteractionPath")
```


Objective-C:
```objective-c
[One sendResponseCode:@"yourCode" forInteractionPath:@"/InteractionPath"];
```

*Note:*
- This method should be used when displaying Optimizations programmatically and you need to capture the user's response.
- This will send a `PUT` request to Thunderhead ONE or Salesforce Interaction Studio.
- When sending Interaction requests programmatically, please ensure the Interaction starts with a `/` and only contains letters, numbers and/or dashes.

### Identity sync

#### Identity sync with Thunderhead ONE or Salesforce Interaction Studio

To synchronise the Safari Mobile identity set by the ONE Tag, or Interaction Studio Tag, with the current app identity, call:

Swift:
```swift
One.identitySync()
```


Objective-C:
```objective-c
[One identitySync];
```

*Note:*
- This functionality only works in iOS 9 and 10.

#### Identity sync with Thunderhead ONE or Salesforce Interaction Studio and your web Touchpoint

To synchronise the Safari Mobile identity set by the ONE Tag, or Interaction Studio Tag, with the current app identity and your web Touchpoint, call:

Swift:
```swift
One.identitySyncWithURL(URL(string: "https://yourWebsite"))
```


Objective-C:
```objective-c
[One identitySyncWithURL:[NSURL URLWithString:@"https://yourwebsite"]];
```

*Note:*
- This functionality only works in iOS 9 and 10.

### Ability to whitelist identity transfer links

The SDK will append a `one-tid` url parameter to all links opened from a mobile app. If you would like to limit this behavior, for the SDK to only append a `one-tid` to a specific set of links, you can whitelist the links to which the SDK should append a `one-tid` by calling the method `whitelistIdentityTransferLinks` and passing your links as shown below:

Swift:
```swift
// This example shows how to whitelist links under specific domain names
// www.google.com and www.uber.com. For example,
// https://www.google.com, https://www.uber.com/en/,
// https://www.uber.com/en/ride/, etc.
One.whitelistIdentityTransferLinks(["www.google.com","www.uber.com"])

// This example shows how to whitelist the main domain name
// wikipedia.org and any subdomains. For example,
// https://en.wikipedia.org, https://simple.wikipedia.org, etc.
One.whitelistIdentityTransferLinks(["*.wikipedia.org"]
```


Objective-C:
```objective-c
// This example shows how to whitelist links for specific domain names
// www.google.com and www.uber.com. For example,
// https://www.google.com, https://www.uber.com/en/,
// https://www.uber.com/en/ride/, etc.
[One whitelistIdentityTransferLinks:@[@"www.google.com", @"www.uber.com"]];

// This example shows how to whitelist the main domain name
// wikipedia.org and any subdomain. For example,
// https://en.wikipedia.org, https://simple.wikipedia.org, etc.
[One whitelistIdentityTransferLinks:@[@"*.wikipedia.org"]];
```

*Note:*
- When a link is whitelisted, a `one-tid` will be appended to the whitelisted link/s only.

### Ability to blacklist identity transfer links

The SDK will append a `one-tid` url parameter to all links opened from a mobile app. If you would like to limit this behaviour, for the SDK to only append a `one-tid` specific set of links, you can blacklist the links to which the SDK should not append a `one-tid` by calling the method `blacklistIdentityTransferLinks` and passing your links as shown below:

Swift:
```swift
// This example shows how to blacklist links under specific domain names
// www.google.com and www.uber.com. For example,
// https://www.google.com, https://www.uber.com/en/,
// https://www.uber.com/en/ride/, etc.
One.blacklistIdentityTransferLinks(["www.google.com","www.uber.com"])

// This example shows how to blacklist the main domain name
// wikipedia.org and any subdomain. For example,
// https://en.wikipedia.org, https://simple.wikipedia.org, etc.
One.blacklistIdentityTransferLinks(["*.wikipedia.org"]
```


Objective-C:
```objective-c
// This example shows how to blacklist links under specific domain names
// www.google.com and www.uber.com. For example,
// https://www.google.com, https://www.uber.com/en-BY/,
// https://www.uber.com/en/ride/, etc.
[One blacklistIdentityTransferLinks :@[@"www.google.com", @"www.uber.com"]];

// This example shows how to blacklist the main domain name
// wikipedia.org and any subdomain. For example,
// https://en.wikipedia.org, https://simple.wikipedia.org, etc.
[One blacklistIdentityTransferLinks:@[@"*.wikipedia.org"]];
```

*Note:*
- If a link is blacklisted, a `one-tid` will be appended to all other links but the blacklisted link.

###    Disable automatic identity transfer

By default, the SDK adds `one-tid` as a URL query parameter to outgoing network requests. To disable it, call the method `disableIdentityTransfer` by passing `true` as shown below:

Swift:
```swift
One.disableIdentityTransfer(true)
```


Objective-C:
```objective-c
[One disableIdentityTransfer:YES];
```

*Note:*
- This will also disable the ability to automatically pick up parameters from deep links that open the app, whilst also preventing the SDK from adding a `one-tid` as a URL query parameter to web links opened from the app, resulting in the customer's identity not being transferred as they move across channels.

#### Send Properties for a URL scheme

If you have disabled automatic identity transfer you can still send all URL parameters received as part of a URL scheme, which opens your app, by calling:

Swift:
```swift
One.handleURL(yourNSURL)
```


Objective-C:
```objective-c
[One handleURL:yourNSURL];
```

passing the URL as a parameter into the handleURL SDK public method, as shown below:

Swift:
```swift
func application(app: UIApplication, openURL url: NSURL, options: [String : AnyObject]) -> Bool  {
    One.handleURL(yourNSURL)
    return true
}
```


Objective-C:
```objective-c
- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application handleOpenURL:(NSURL *)url {
    [One handleURL:url];
    return YES;
}
```
*Note:*
- This will send a PUT request to Thunderhead ONE or Salesforce Interaction Studio.

#### Append a `one-tid` parameter to a `NSURL` to facilitate identity transfer

If you have disabled automatic identity transfer, you can still add a `one-tid` parameter to a link opened from the app programmatically, by calling `getURLWithOneTid` as shown below:

Swift:
```swift
One.getURLWithOneTid(yourNSURL)
```


Objective-C:
```objective-c
[One getURLWithOneTid:yourNSURL];
```

passing the URL as a parameter, which will return back a the same `NSURL` containing a `one-tid` parameter.

Swift:
```swift
let urlWithOneTid = One.getURLWithOneTid(yourNSURL)
```


Objective-C:
```objective-c
NSURL *urlWithOneTid = [One getURLWithOneTid:yourNSURL];
```

### Disable automatic outbound link tracking

By default, the SDK will automatically send an Interaction request to `/one-click` as a url is opened in Safari, `SafariViewController` or `WKWebView` to facilitate last click attribution.

To disable this functionality call the `disableAutomaticOutboundLinkTracking` method and pass `true`, as shown below:

Swift:
```swift
One.disableAutomaticOutboundLinkTracking(true)
```


Objective-C:
```objective-c
[One disableAutomaticOutboundLinkTracking:YES];
```

#### Programmatically trigger an outbound link tracking Interaction call

If you have disabled automatic outbound link tracking, you can still track a URL, by calling:

Swift:
```swift
One.sendInteractionForOutboundLink(yourNSURL)
```


Objective-C:
```objective-c
[One sendInteractionForOutboundLink:yourNSURL];
```

passing the URL which will send an Interaction request ‘/one-click’ using the same logic as available automatically.

*Note:*
- This will send a POST request to Thunderhead ONE or Salesforce Interaction Studio.


### Send a location object

To send a location object, call:

Swift:
```swift
One.updateLocation(location)
```


Objective-C:
```objective-c
[One updateLocation:location];
```

passing the location object as a parameter to the `updateLocation` method. Use `CLLocationManager` delegate methods to call `updateLocation`, as shown below:

Swift:
```swift
func locationManager(manager: CLLocationManager, didUpdateLocations locations: [CLLocation]) {
    One.updateLocation(locations.first)
}
```


Objective-C:
```objective-c
- (void)locationManager:(CLLocationManager *)manager didUpdateLocations:(NSArray *)locations {
    [One updateLocation:[locations firstObject]];
}
```

### Get a structure data

To get a structure data, call `getStructureData` method by passing a structure’s name and a completion block as shown below:

Swift:
```swift
One.getStructureData("yourStructureName") { (response, error) in
    if (error == nil) {
        // work with response
    }
}
```


Objective-C:
```objective-c
[One getStructureData:@"yourStructureName" withBlock:^(NSDictionary *response, NSError *error) {
    if (!error) {
        // work with response
    }
}];
```

### Get Tid

To get the current `tid` used by the SDK, call:

Swift:
```swift
One.getTid
```


Objective-C:
```objective-c
[One getTid];
```

*Note:*
- This will return the `tid` assigned to the current user as a `NSString`.
- Retrieving the current `tid` can be useful if you want to monitor the current user in Thunderhead ONE or Salesforce Interaction Studio.
- The tid can also be used if you need to pass the identity of the current user to another system which sends data to Thunderhead ONE or Salesforce Interaction Studio.

### Access debug information

The Thunderhead SDK for iOS provides 5 distinct debugging levels, that can be enabled in the `didFinishLaunchingWithOptions` method of your project's AppDelegate, as shown below:

*Note:* All Thunderhead SDK log messages will be prefixed with `[Thunderhead]` in the console.

1. `kOneLogLevelNone` - if set, no messages will be displayed in the console.

    Swift:
    ```swift
    One.setLogLevel(.None)
    ```


    Objective-C:
    ```objective-c
    [One setLogLevel:kOneLogLevelNone];
    ```

2. `kOneLogLevelAll` - if set, all log messages will be displayed in the console.

    Swift:
    ```swift
    One.setLogLevel(.All)
    ```


    Objective-C:
    ```objective-c
    [One setLogLevel:kOneLogLevelAll];
    ```

3. `kOneLogLevelWebService` - if set, only web service logs will be displayed in the console.

    Swift:
    ```swift
    One.setLogLevel(.WebService)
    ```


    Objective-C:
    ```objective-c
    [One setLogLevel:kOneLogLevelWebService];
    ```

4. `kOneLogLevelFramework` - if set, only framework logs will be displayed in the console.

    Swift:
    ```swift
    One.setLogLevel(.Framework)
    ```


    Objective-C:
    ```objective-c
    [One setLogLevel:kOneLogLevelFramework];
    ```
    
5. `kOneLogLevelDebug` - if set, only debug logs will be displayed in the console.

    Swift:
    ```swift
    One.setLogLevel(.Debug)
    ```


    Objective-C:
    ```objective-c
    [One setLogLevel:kOneLogLevelDebug];
    ```

*Note:*
- By default, the Thunderhead SDK for iOS does not display any debug log messages. However, exception messages are printed in the console, when these occur.

### Identify the framework version

You can find out the current version of the framework by calling:

Swift:
```swift
One.frameworkVersion()
```


Objective-C:
```objective-c
[One frameworkVersion];
```

### Clear the user profile

You can programmatically erase the user profile data by calling:

Swift:
```swift
One.clearUserProfile()
```


Objective-C:
```objective-c
[One clearUserProfile];
```

*Note:*
- This method removes `tid` from local storage only.
- For instructions on how to completely remove a user's data from Thunderhead ONE or Salesforce Interaction Studio - see our [api documentation](https://thunderheadone.github.io/one-api/#operation/delete).
